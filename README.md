# Candywatch (Client source code)

This is the front-end code for [candywatch](https://candywatch.net "candywatch")

## What is candywatch?
Candywatch is a project I started out of frustration built up while using [watch2gether](https://w2g.tv/ "candywatch").
I used to watch tons of youtube with my friends/girlfriend there, and the experience was, to say the least, unpleasant.

The UI was laggy, unresponsive, the design was kinda bad, and I was looking for a hobby project.

So I decided to write this in my spare time.
It's a clean, database-less, fast, minimalistic website, where you can watch youtube with other people.


### Note
This project is in the very early stages of development.
There are a few bugs that I am aware exist, and some features are not implemented, keep in mind that this is still a WIP.
